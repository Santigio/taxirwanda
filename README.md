# Project Title: Interactive Map Application
Overview

This project implements an interactive mapping solution using Google Maps API, designed for real-time navigation and route optimization. The primary function of this application is to assist users in navigating between multiple stops efficiently, displaying real-time location, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and critical waypoints.

The application is built with React and integrates various Google Maps services, making it suitable for deployment in logistics, delivery services, or any domain requiring complex route planning and execution.
Tools Used

    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
    Google Maps JavaScript API: Provides interactive mapping capabilities directly within web pages.
    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for creating a powerful server-side application.
    npm/Yarn: Package managers for node to manage the project's dependencies.
